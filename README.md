# Regression-Case-Study

The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that can predict alumni giving rate if certain attributes related to university are given. The regression model is built from alumni dataset that contains 48 observations and has four variables of interest - percentage of classes under 20, student faculty ratio, private and alumni giving rate.
This model would be helpful in finding factors that influence alumni donation rate which would help management of an university to take necessary steps in that direction. This would help university to get more funds helping them to further improve these factors. This becomes a continuous cycle.
